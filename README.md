# JavaScript Hey all! This repository contains all of the projects I completed while learning JavaScript. Here's a brief description of all of them: 

 - if you look at Project folders 1-10 you'll see all that I've learned and how far I've progressed :)
 - in the Basic JavasScripts folder you can see where I start putting everything together
 - Pizza Project: feeling hungry on a budget? Step right up, build your own pizza, and watch the pieces come together! 
 - One-page website: a one-page website about tea, decorated with pictures of plants. A delightful combination! ðŸª´
 - Bootstrap Project folder: there are 3 projects here - bootstrap project 4, which was a lot of fun; Challenge 5 which I spent the most time on; and Academy Cinemas, where you can see which movies are playing and what times 
 - TicTacToe: a tictactoe game - the X's and O's are a little different from what you'd expect, but it's fun and there's a lot of cool sound effects! 
 - jQuery: here, I use jQuery for the first time to help with coding! 

Welcome!
